%%% This script defines the parameters that need to be defined and then
%%% runs all necessary subscripts to be able to output and plot the
%%% performance of the rocket with time. This script should make it very
%%% easy to modify input parameters to observe their effects on the output
%%% parameters so we can tweak the performance to match that which is
%%% desired.
